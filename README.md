<h1>How to install Smart Port Scanner</h1>


1. **Install Python:** First, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You can check if you have Python installed by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
python --version
If Python is not installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. **Install required libraries:** The script requires the requests library to send HTTP requests. You can install this library by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install requests
3. Download the script: Save the script to a directory on your system by copying and pasting the code into a text editor (such as Notepad) and saving it as a .py file.

4. **Run the script:** Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script. Then, enter the following command to run the script:

Copy code
python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the name of the script file.

5. **Enter the host to scan:** When prompted, enter the IP address or hostname of the host you want to scan. The script will then create a separate thread for each port and scan them concurrently. If any open ports are found, the script will print a message indicating the port number and the service running on that port. If no open ports are found, the script will print a message indicating that no ports are online.
